## My experience

💳 I spent this past summer as a data science intern at Mastercard out of their technology hub in St. Louis, MO, harnessing Splunk to automate IT operations on the AIOps team
<br><br>
🗳 Previously, I collaborated on the Elections in Pandemic team through the Duke University Bass Connections Program, building statistical models to quantify the disproportate rate at which young voters and voters of color cast provisional ballots in North Carolina
