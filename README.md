## My experience
📰 This past summer, I interned on the Algorithmic Targeting Team at the New York Times, using clustering algorithms in Python to improve the NYT paywall model
<br><br>
💳 I spent my sophomore summer as a data science intern at Mastercard out of their technology hub in St. Louis, MO, harnessing Splunk to automate IT operations on the AIOps team
<br><br>
🗳 Previously, I collaborated on the Elections in Pandemic team through the Duke University Bass Connections Program, building statistical models to quantify the disproportate rate at which young voters and voters of color cast provisional ballots in North Carolina
